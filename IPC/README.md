Let's break down the `pthread_create()` function and its arguments:

```c
int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr,
                   void *(*start_routine) (void *), void *arg);
```

- **`thread`**: This is a pointer to a `pthread_t` variable where the thread identifier (ID) will be stored if the thread creation is successful. The `pthread_t` type is an opaque data type representing a thread ID.
  - **Return value**: If the function call succeeds, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns an error code indicating the reason for failure.

- **`attr`**: This argument allows you to specify attributes for the new thread, such as its scheduling policy, stack size, etc. If you pass `NULL`, default attributes will be used.

- **`start_routine`**: This is a pointer to the function that the thread will execute once it starts. The function must take a single `void *` argument and return a `void *`. This argument specifies the entry point of the thread.

- **`arg`**: This is a pointer to an argument that will be passed to the `start_routine` function when the thread is created. It can be used to pass data to the thread.
