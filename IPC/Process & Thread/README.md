# Process
A process in an operating system is an instance of a running program. It includes the program code and its current activity, such as the program counter, registers, and variables. Processes are fundamental to the structure of the operating system, allowing multiple programs to run concurrently by sharing CPU time.
## Key Concepts of a Process
### Process States:
- **New:** The process is being created.
-	**Running:** Instructions are being executed.
-	**Waiting:** The process is waiting for some event to occur.
-	**Ready:** The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.
-	**Terminated:** The process has finished execution.
### Process State Transitions:
Processes transition between these states based on various events:
-	**New to Ready:** When a process is created.
-	**Ready to Running:** When the scheduler selects the process for execution.
-	**Running to Waiting:** When the process needs to wait for an event.
-	**Waiting to Ready:** When the event the process was waiting for occurs.
-	**Running to Ready:** When the process is preempted by the scheduler.
-	**Running to Terminated:** When the process finishes execution or is killed.
### Process Control Block (PCB):
Contains information about the process, such as:
-	Process ID (PID)
-	Program counter
-	CPU registers
-	Memory management information
-	I/O status information
-	Accounting information
### Process Scheduling:
The OS schedules processes based on algorithms like First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Priority Scheduling, Round Robin, etc.
-	**First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):** Processes are scheduled in the order they arrive.
-	**Shortest Job Next (SJN):** Processes with the shortest execution time are scheduled first.
-	**Priority Scheduling:** Processes are scheduled based on priority.
-	**Round Robin (RR):** Each process is assigned a fixed time slice and cycles through processes in a round-robin fashion.
### Process Creation and Termination:
-	Processes are created using system calls like fork() and terminated using exit() or by being killed by another process.
Detailed Example with Source Code
Here, we will delve into process creation, execution, and termination using system calls in C.
**Example:** Process Creation and Execution
This example demonstrates how a new process is created using fork(), and how the child process executes a new program using execvp(), while the parent process waits for the child to complete.
```C++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
int main() {
    pid_t pid;
    // Fork a new process
    pid = fork();
    if (pid < 0) {
        // Fork failed
        perror("fork failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        printf("Child process (PID: %d) created.\n", getpid());
        // Execute a new program (e.g., `ls -l`)
        char *args[] = {"ls", "-l", NULL};
        if (execvp(args[0], args) == -1) {
            perror("execvp failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    } else {
        // Parent process
        printf("Parent process (PID: %d) waiting for child (PID: %d) to finish.\n", getpid(), pid);
        // Wait for the child process to complete
        int status;
        if (waitpid(pid, &status, 0) == -1) {
            perror("waitpid failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
        // Check the termination status of the child
        if (WIFEXITED(status)) {
            printf("Child process exited with status %d.\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));
        } else {
            printf("Child process did not exit normally.\n");
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
**Explanation of the Code:**
### Forking a Process:
-	fork() is called to create a new process.
-	If fork() returns a negative value, it indicates that the fork failed.
-	If fork() returns 0, the code is running in the child process.
-	If fork() returns a positive value, the code is running in the parent process, and the returned value is the PID of the child process.
### Child Process Execution:
-	In the child process, execvp() is called to replace the current process image with a new program (ls -l in this case).
-	execvp() takes two arguments: the program to execute and an array of arguments.
-	If execvp() fails, it returns -1, and an error message is printed.
### Parent Process Waiting:
-	The parent process uses waitpid() to wait for the child process to terminate.
-	waitpid() returns the PID of the child whose state has changed.
-	The termination status of the child is examined using macros WIFEXITED() and WEXITSTATUS().
## Additional Concepts
### Process ID (PID):
-	Every process is assigned a unique identifier called a PID.
-	PIDs are used to manage and control processes.
### Orphan and Zombie Processes:
-	**Orphan:** A process whose parent has terminated. The init process (PID 1) adopts orphan processes.
-	**Zombie:** A process that has terminated but still has an entry in the process table. It occurs when a parent process has not yet called wait().
### Inter-Process Communication (IPC):
-	Processes often need to communicate with each other.
-	IPC mechanisms include pipes, message queues, shared memory, and semaphores.
**Example:**
```C++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
    pid_t pid;
    pid = fork();
    if (pid < 0) {
        perror("fork failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        printf("Child process (PID: %d) created.\n", getpid());
        sleep(5); // Simulate some work in the child process
        printf("Child process (PID: %d) done.\n", getpid());
    } else {
        // Parent process
        printf("Parent process (PID: %d) terminating.\n", getpid());
        exit(0); // Parent process terminates immediately
    }
    return 0;
}
```
**In this example:**
-	The parent process terminates immediately after forking the child process.
-	The child process continues to run and becomes an orphan after the parent terminates.
-	The init process (PID 1) will adopt the orphan child process.
## Process Control Block (PCB) and Context Switching:
When the CPU switches from one process to another, it performs a context switch. During a context switch:
-	The state of the current process is saved in its PCB.
-	The state of the next process to run is loaded from its PCB.
-	This involves saving and restoring the process's register values, program counter, and other state information.
### Process Synchronization:
Process synchronization is a mechanism to control the order in which processes execute their instructions, especially when multiple processes are accessing shared resources concurrently. Synchronization ensures that processes operate correctly and predictably, avoiding issues such as race conditions, deadlocks, and inconsistent data.

**Key Concepts**
-	**Critical Section:** A section of code that accesses shared resources and must not be executed by more than one process at a time.
-	**Race Condition:** Occurs when multiple processes or threads access and modify shared data concurrently, leading to unpredictable results.
-	**Deadlock:** A situation where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource.
-	**Starvation:** A situation where a process is perpetually denied necessary resources to proceed.
## Synchronization Mechanisms
Various synchronization mechanisms are used to handle concurrent access to shared resources and to ensure the correct sequence of execution among processes.
### 1. Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)
Mutex is a lock mechanism used to protect critical sections. Only one process can acquire the lock and execute the critical section at any given time.
Example in C++ using std::mutex:
```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
std::mutex mtx;
int shared_counter = 0;
void increment(int num_iterations) {
    for (int i = 0; i < num_iterations; ++i) {
        mtx.lock();
        ++shared_counter;
        mtx.unlock();
    }
}
int main() {
    std::thread t1(increment, 1000);
    std::thread t2(increment, 1000);
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    std::cout << "Final counter value: " << shared_counter << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
### 2. Semaphores
Semaphores are signalling mechanisms that use counters to control access to shared resources. There are two types:

-	**Counting Semaphores:** Can have a value greater than one, allowing multiple processes to access the resource.
-	**Binary Semaphores:** Like mutexes, they can only have values 0 and 1.
Example in C using POSIX semaphores:
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <semaphore.h>
#define NUM_ITERATIONS 1000
int counter = 0;
sem_t sem;
void* increment(void* arg) {
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_ITERATIONS; ++i) {
        sem_wait(&sem);
        ++counter;
        sem_post(&sem);
    }
    return NULL;
}
int main() {
    pthread_t t1, t2;
    sem_init(&sem, 0, 1);
    pthread_create(&t1, NULL, increment, NULL);
    pthread_create(&t2, NULL, increment, NULL);
    pthread_join(t1, NULL);
    pthread_join(t2, NULL);
    sem_destroy(&sem);
    printf("Final counter value: %d\n", counter);
    return 0;
}
```
### 3. Condition Variables
Condition variables are used for signaling between threads. A condition variable allows threads to wait for certain conditions to be met.
Example in C++ using std::condition_variable:
```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>
std::mutex mtx;
std::condition_variable cv;
bool ready = false;
void print_id(int id) {
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    cv.wait(lock, [] { return ready; });
    std::cout << "Thread " << id << std::endl;
}
void set_ready() {
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    ready = true;
    cv.notify_all();
}
int main() {
    std::thread threads[10];
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
        threads[i] = std::thread(print_id, i);
    std::thread t(set_ready);
    for (auto& th : threads)
        th.join();
    t.join();
    return 0;
}
```
### 4. Monitors
Monitors are high-level synchronization constructs that encapsulate shared variables, the procedures that operate on them, and the synchronization between concurrent procedures. In C++, this is typically implemented using classes that manage the mutex and condition variables internally.
Example in C++:
```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>
class Monitor {
    std::mutex mtx;
    std::condition_variable cv;
    int shared_counter;
public:
    Monitor() : shared_counter(0) {}
    void increment() {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        ++shared_counter;
        cv.notify_all();
    }
    int get_counter() {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        return shared_counter;
    }
};
void worker(Monitor& monitor, int num_iterations) {
    for (int i = 0; i < num_iterations; ++i) {
        monitor.increment();
    }
}
int main() {
    Monitor monitor;
    const int num_iterations = 1000;
    std::thread t1(worker, std::ref(monitor), num_iterations);
    std::thread t2(worker, std::ref(monitor), num_iterations);
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    std::cout << "Final counter value: " << monitor.get_counter() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
### Conclusion
Process synchronization is crucial for ensuring the correct execution of concurrent processes, especially when they access shared resources. Various synchronization mechanisms, including mutexes, semaphores, condition variables, and monitors, provide different levels of control and complexity to manage concurrent execution effectively. Understanding these mechanisms is key to designing robust and efficient concurrent systems.

# Threads
## Definition and Overview
A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. It represents a single sequence of instructions executed independently but within the context of a process. Threads share the same memory space and resources of the process they belong to but have their own execution context, such as a program counter, stack, and registers.
### Benefits of Using Threads
-	**Concurrency:** Allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, improving the efficiency of CPU utilization.
-	**Responsiveness:** Threads enable applications to remain responsive by performing background tasks without blocking the main execution flow.
-	**Resource Sharing:** Threads within the same process can share data and resources more efficiently than separate processes.
-	**Scalability:** Multi-threaded programs can take advantage of multi-core processors, improving performance.
### Key Concepts of Threads
-	**Thread Creation:** Threads can be created by a process to perform tasks concurrently.
-	**Thread Execution:** Threads within a process execute independently but share the same address space.
-	**Thread Synchronization:** Mechanisms are required to ensure that threads coordinate correctly when accessing shared resources.
-	**Thread Termination:** Threads terminate upon completion of their task or can be explicitly terminated by other threads.
**Example:** Thread Creation and Execution in C
We'll use the POSIX thread (pthreads) library to illustrate thread creation, execution, and synchronization.
Creating and Executing Threads
Here's an example demonstrating how to create and execute threads using the pthreads library:
```C++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>
// Function to be executed by the thread
void* thread_function(void* arg) {
    int* thread_id = (int*)arg;
    printf("Thread %d is running.\n", *thread_id);
    return NULL;
}
int main() {
    pthread_t threads[5];
    int thread_ids[5];
    // Create 5 threads
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        thread_ids[i] = i + 1;
        if (pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, thread_function, &thread_ids[i]) != 0) {
            perror("pthread_create failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    }
    // Wait for all threads to complete
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        if (pthread_join(threads[i], NULL) != 0) {
            perror("pthread_join failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    }
    printf("All threads have completed.\n");
    return 0;
}
```
**Explanation of the Code**
### Thread Function:
-	thread_function(void* arg) is the function executed by each thread. It takes a single argument and returns a pointer.
-	In this example, it simply prints the thread ID.
### Creating Threads:
-	pthread_create() is used to create a new thread. It takes four arguments:
-	The thread identifier (pthread_t).
-	Thread attributes (set to NULL for default attributes).
-	The function to be executed by the thread.
-	The argument to be passed to the thread function.
### Joining Threads:
-	pthread_join() is used to wait for a thread to terminate. It ensures that the main program waits for all threads to complete before exiting.

# Thread Synchronization:
When multiple threads access shared resources, synchronization mechanisms are necessary to avoid conflicts and ensure data consistency.
## 1.	Thread Synchronization using Mutexes:
A mutex (mutual exclusion) is a synchronization primitive used to protect shared data by allowing only one thread to access the resource at a time.
Here's an example using mutexes:
```C++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>
pthread_mutex_t mutex;
int counter = 0;
// Function to be executed by the thread
void* thread_function(void* arg) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {
// Lock the mutex before accessing the shared resource
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
        ++counter;
        // Unlock the mutex after accessing the shared resource
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
    }
    return NULL;
}
int main() {
    pthread_t threads[5];
    // Initialize the mutex
    if (pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL) != 0) {
        perror("pthread_mutex_init failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    // Create 5 threads
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        if (pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, thread_function, NULL) != 0) {
            perror("pthread_create failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    }
    // Wait for all threads to complete
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        if (pthread_join(threads[i], NULL) != 0) {
            perror("pthread_join failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    }
    // Destroy the mutex
    if (pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex) != 0) {
        perror("pthread_mutex_destroy failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    printf("Counter value: %d\n", counter);
    return 0;
 }
```
**Explanation of the Code**
### Mutex Initialization:
-	**pthread_mutex_init()** initializes the mutex. It takes two arguments: a pointer to the mutex and optional attributes (set to NULL for default attributes).
### Locking and Unlocking the Mutex:
-	**pthread_mutex_lock()** locks the mutex before accessing the shared resource (counter).
-	**pthread_mutex_unlock()** unlocks the mutex after accessing the shared resource.
### Mutex Destruction:
-	**pthread_mutex_destroy()** destroys the mutex, freeing any resources it may have allocated.

## 2.	Thread Synchronization using Condition Variables:
Used to block a thread until a particular condition is met. They work in conjunction with mutexes.

**Example:**
```C++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>
pthread_mutex_t mutex;
pthread_cond_t cond;
int ready = 0;
// Function to be executed by the thread
void* thread_function(void* arg) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
    while (!ready) {
        pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &mutex);
    }
    printf("Thread %ld is running.\n", (long)arg);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
    return NULL;
}
int main() {
    pthread_t threads[5];
    // Initialize the mutex and condition variable
    if (pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL) != 0) {
        perror("pthread_mutex_init failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    if (pthread_cond_init(&cond, NULL) != 0) {
        perror("pthread_cond_init failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    // Create 5 threads
    for (long i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        if (pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, thread_function, (void*)i) != 0) {
            perror("pthread_create failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    }
    // Simulate some work in the main thread
    sleep(2);
    // Signal all threads to proceed
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
    ready = 1;
    pthread_cond_broadcast(&cond);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
    // Wait for all threads to complete
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        if (pthread_join(threads[i], NULL) != 0) {
            perror("pthread_join failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    }
    // Destroy the mutex and condition variable
    if (pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex) != 0) {
        perror("pthread_mutex_destroy failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    if (pthread_cond_destroy(&cond) != 0) {
        perror("pthread_cond_destroy failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    printf("All threads have completed.\n");
    return 0;
}
```
**Explanation of the Code**
-	**Condition Variable Initialization:** pthread_cond_init() initializes the condition variable.
-	**Waiting on Condition Variable:** pthread_cond_wait() is used by threads to wait for the condition to be signaled. It automatically releases the mutex while waiting and reacquires it when signaled.
-	**Signaling Condition Variable:** pthread_cond_broadcast() signals all waiting threads to proceed. Alternatively, pthread_cond_signal() can be used to signal a single waiting thread.
-	**Condition Variable Destruction:** pthread_cond_destroy() destroys the condition variable.


## 3.	Thread Synchronization using Semaphores:
Semaphores are synchronization primitives used to control access to shared resources by multiple threads in concurrent programming. A semaphore can be thought of as a counter that controls access to shared resources by multiple threads. It supports two atomic operations:
-	**wait() (or P):** Decreases the semaphore value. If the value is zero, the thread is blocked until the value becomes positive.
-	**signal() (or V):** Increases the semaphore value and if there are any blocked threads, it wakes one up.
**Example:**
In this example, we have a shared counter that multiple threads will increment. We'll use a semaphore to ensure that only one thread can access the counter at a time.
```C++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <semaphore.h>
#define NUM_THREADS 5
#define NUM_ITERATIONS 1000000
// Shared counter
int counter = 0;
// Semaphore for synchronization
sem_t semaphore;
// Thread function to increment the counter
void* increment_counter(void* arg) {
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_ITERATIONS; ++i) {
        // Wait (decrement) the semaphore
        sem_wait(&semaphore);
        // Increment the counter
        ++counter;
        // Signal (increment) the semaphore
        sem_post(&semaphore);
    }
    return NULL;
}
int main() {
    pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];
 // Initialize the semaphore with an initial value of 1
    if (sem_init(&semaphore, 0, 1) != 0) {
        perror("sem_init failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    // Create threads
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; ++i) {
        if (pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, increment_counter, NULL) != 0) {
            perror("pthread_create failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    }
    // Wait for all threads to complete
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; ++i) {
        if (pthread_join(threads[i], NULL) != 0) {
            perror("pthread_join failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    }
    // Destroy the semaphore
    if (sem_destroy(&semaphore) != 0) {
        perror("sem_destroy failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    // Print the final value of the counter
    printf("Final counter value: %d\n", counter);
    return 0;
}
```
**Explanation of the Code**
## Semaphore Initialization:
sem_init(&semaphore, 0, 1) initializes the semaphore. The second argument (0) indicates that the semaphore is shared between threads of the same process. The third argument (1) is the initial value of the semaphore, indicating that only one thread can access the critical section at a time.
### Thread Function: 
increment_counter() is the function executed by each thread. It performs a loop where each iteration consists of:
-	**sem_wait(&semaphore):** This decrements the semaphore value. If the value is zero, the thread blocks until the semaphore is available.
-	Incrementing the shared counter.
-	**sem_post(&semaphore):** This increments the semaphore value, potentially waking up a blocked thread.
### Thread Creation and Joining:
-	pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, increment_counter, NULL) creates a new thread that runs the increment_counter function.
-	pthread_join(threads[i], NULL) waits for the specified thread to terminate.
### Semaphore Destruction:
sem_destroy(&semaphore) destroys the semaphore, releasing any resources it holds.
**Advanced Example:** Producer-Consumer Problem
The producer-consumer problem is a classic synchronization problem where multiple producer threads generate data and multiple consumer threads process that data. Semaphores are used to synchronize access to a shared buffer.
Example Implementation
```C++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <semaphore.h>
#define BUFFER_SIZE 10
#define NUM_ITEMS 50
int buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
int count = 0;
sem_t empty, full, mutex;
void* producer(void* arg) {
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_ITEMS; ++i) {
        // Produce an item (in this case, just the item number)
        int item = i;
        // Wait if the buffer is full
        sem_wait(&empty);
        // Lock the buffer
        sem_wait(&mutex);
        // Add the item to the buffer
        buffer[count] = item;
        count++;
        printf("Produced item: %d\n", item); 
        // Unlock the buffer
        sem_post(&mutex);
        // Signal that the buffer is not empty
        sem_post(&full);
    }
    return NULL;
}
void* consumer(void* arg) {
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_ITEMS; ++i) {

```
**Explanation of the Code**
### Semaphores Initialization:
-	sem_init(&empty, 0, BUFFER_SIZE): Controls how many empty slots are available in the buffer. Initialized to the buffer size.
-	sem_init(&full, 0, 0): Controls how many items are in the buffer. Initialized to zero.
-	sem_init(&mutex, 0, 1): Provides mutual exclusion for buffer access.
### Producer Function:
-	Produces items and adds them to the buffer. Uses sem_wait(&empty) to wait if the buffer is full and sem_wait(&mutex) to lock the buffer.
-	After adding an item, it unlocks the buffer with sem_post(&mutex) and signals that there is one more item in the buffer with sem_post(&full).
### Consumer Function:
-	Consumes items from the buffer. Uses sem_wait(&full) to wait if the buffer is empty and sem_wait(&mutex) to lock the buffer.
-	After consuming an item, it unlocks the buffer with sem_post(&mutex) and signals that there is one more empty slot in the buffer with sem_post(&empty).
## 4.	Thread Synchronization using Read-Write Locks:
Read-Write locks, also known as shared-exclusive locks, allow multiple threads to read from a shared resource concurrently while ensuring exclusive access for threads that need to write to the resource. This improves performance in scenarios where read operations are more frequent than write operations.
Read-Write locks support three operations:
-	**Read Lock (or Shared Lock):** Multiple threads can acquire the read lock simultaneously if no thread holds the write lock.
-	**Write Lock (or Exclusive Lock):** Only one thread can acquire the write lock, and it ensures exclusive access to the resource.
-	**Unlock:** Releases the lock, whether it was a read lock or a write lock..
**Example:**
In this example, we have a shared counter that multiple threads will read from and write to. We'll use a read-write lock to allow multiple threads to read the counter simultaneously, but only one thread to write to it at a time.
```C++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <unistd.h>
// Shared counter
int counter = 0;
// Read-write lock
pthread_rwlock_t rwlock;
// Reader thread function
void* reader(void* arg) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        // Acquire read lock
        pthread_rwlock_rdlock(&rwlock);
        // Read the counter
        printf("Reader %ld: Counter value: %d\n", (long)arg, counter);
        // Release read lock
        pthread_rwlock_unlock(&rwlock);
        // Sleep to simulate work
        usleep(100000);
    }
    return NULL;
}
// Writer thread function
void* writer(void* arg) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        // Acquire write lock
        pthread_rwlock_wrlock(&rwlock);
        // Write to the counter
        counter++;
        printf("Writer %ld: Incremented counter to: %d\n", (long)arg, counter);
        // Release write lock
        pthread_rwlock_unlock(&rwlock);
        // Sleep to simulate work
        usleep(150000);
    }
    return NULL;
int main() {
    pthread_t readers[5], writers[2];
    // Initialize the read-write lock
    if (pthread_rwlock_init(&rwlock, NULL) != 0) {
        perror("pthread_rwlock_init failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    // Create reader threads
    for (long i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        if (pthread_create(&readers[i], NULL, reader, (void*)i) != 0) {
            perror("pthread_create failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    }
    // Create writer threads
    for (long i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
        if (pthread_create(&writers[i], NULL, writer, (void*)i) != 0) {
            perror("pthread_create failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    }
    // Wait for reader threads to complete
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        if (pthread_join(readers[i], NULL) != 0) {
            perror("pthread_join failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    }
    // Wait for writer threads to complete
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
        if (pthread_join(writers[i], NULL) != 0) {
            perror("pthread_join failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    }
    // Destroy the read-write lock
    if (pthread_rwlock_destroy(&rwlock) != 0) {
        perror("pthread_rwlock_destroy failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    printf("All threads have completed.\n");
    return 0;
}
```
**Explanation of the Code**
### Read-Write Lock Initialization:
-	pthread_rwlock_init(&rwlock, NULL) initializes the read-write lock. The second argument (NULL) indicates default attributes.
### Reader Function:
The reader function is executed by reader threads. It performs a loop where each iteration consists of:
-	**pthread_rwlock_rdlock(&rwlock):** Acquires the read lock. Multiple reader threads can acquire this lock simultaneously if no writer holds the write lock.
-	Reading the counter value and printing it.
-	**pthread_rwlock_unlock(&rwlock):** Releases the read lock.
-	**usleep(100000):** Sleeps for 100 milliseconds to simulate work.
### Writer Function:
The writer function is executed by writer threads. It performs a loop where each iteration consists of:
-	**pthread_rwlock_wrlock(&rwlock):** Acquires the write lock. Only one writer thread can hold this lock at a time, and no reader threads can hold the read lock.
-	Incrementing the counter and printing the new value.
-	**pthread_rwlock_unlock(&rwlock):** Releases the write lock.
-	**usleep(150000):** Sleeps for 150 milliseconds to simulate work.
### Thread Creation and Joining:
-	pthread_create(&readers[i], NULL, reader, (void*)i): Creates a new reader thread that runs the reader function.
-	pthread_create(&writers[i], NULL, writer, (void*)i): Creates a new writer thread that runs the writer function.
-	pthread_join(readers[i], NULL): Waits for the specified reader thread to terminate.
-	pthread_join(writers[i], NULL): Waits for the specified writer thread to terminate.
### Read-Write Lock Destruction:
-	pthread_rwlock_destroy(&rwlock): Destroys the read-write lock, releasing any resources it holds.
### Thread Pools
A thread pool is a collection of worker threads that efficiently manage the execution of many tasks. Instead of creating and destroying threads for each task, a thread pool maintains a pool of reusable threads.
**Example:** Simple Thread Pool
Here's an example of a simple thread pool implementation:
```C++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#define THREAD_POOL_SIZE 4
#define TASK_QUEUE_SIZE 10
typedef struct {
    void (*function)(void*);
    void* arg;
} Task;
typedef struct {
    Task task_queue[TASK_QUEUE_SIZE];
    int task_count;
    int task_index;
    pthread_mutex_t mutex;
    pthread_cond_t cond;
    pthread_t threads[THREAD_POOL_SIZE];
} ThreadPool;
void* thread_function(void* arg) {
    ThreadPool* pool = (ThreadPool*)arg;
    while (1) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&pool->mutex);
        while (pool->task_count == 0) {
            pthread_cond_wait(&pool->cond, &pool->mutex);
        }
        Task task = pool->task_queue[pool->task_index];
        pool->task_index = (pool->task_index + 1) % TASK_QUEUE_SIZE;
        pool->task_count--;
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&pool->mutex);
        task.function(task.arg);
    }
    return NULL;
}
void initialize_thread_pool(ThreadPool* pool) {
    pool->task_count = 0;
    pool->task_index = 0;
    pthread_mutex_init(&pool->mutex, NULL);
    pthread_cond_init(&pool->cond, NULL);
    for (int i = 0; i < THREAD_POOL_SIZE; ++i) {
        pthread_create(&pool->threads[i], NULL, thread_function, pool);
    }
}
void add_task_to_pool(ThreadPool* pool, void (*function)(void*), void* arg) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&pool->mutex);
    if (pool->task_count < TASK_QUEUE_SIZE) {
        int task_index = (pool->task_index + pool->task_count) % TASK_QUEUE_SIZE;
        pool->task_queue[task_index].function = function;
        pool->task_queue[task_index].arg = arg;
        pool->task_count++;
        pthread_cond_signal(&pool->cond);
    }
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&pool->mutex);
}
void example_task(void* arg) {
    int* num = (int*)arg;
    printf("Executing task with number: %d\n", *num);
    sleep(1); // Simulate task execution
}
int main() {
    ThreadPool pool;
    initialize_thread_pool(&pool);
    int numbers[10];
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        numbers[i] = i + 1;
        add_task_to_pool(&pool, example_task, &numbers[i]);
    }
    sleep(10); // Wait for tasks to complete
    printf("All tasks have been added to the pool.\n");
    return 0;
}
```
**Explanation of the Code**
-	**Task Structure:** The Task structure holds a function pointer and its argument.
-	**Thread Pool Initialization:** The initialize_thread_pool() function initializes the thread pool, creating a fixed number of worker threads.
-	**Adding Tasks to the Pool:** The add_task_to_pool() function adds tasks to the task queue and signals worker threads to start executing tasks.
-	**Worker Thread Execution:** The thread_function() represents the worker thread function, which waits for tasks, executes them, and repeats.

Thread pools improve performance by reusing threads and reducing the overhead of thread creation and destruction.

Threads are essential for concurrent execution in modern operating systems and applications. They enable efficient use of CPU resources, responsiveness in applications, and scalability on multi-core systems. Proper thread synchronization and management techniques, such as mutexes, condition variables, and thread pools, are crucial for writing robust multi-threaded programs.

| Feature | Process | Thread |
|------------|------------|------------|
|**Definition**|An independent program in execution with its own memory space.|A lightweight unit of execution within a process. Shares memory space with other threads in the same process.|
|**Memory**|Each process has its own separate memory space.|Threads share the same memory space and resources of the process they belong to.|
|**Communication**|Inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms are needed for processes to communicate (e.g., pipes, message queues, shared memory).|Communication is simpler and faster since threads share the same address space. Can use variables, memory, and more.|
|**Creation**|Creating a process is resource-intensive and slower (involves duplicating the process memory).|Creating a thread is lighter and faster since it only requires creating a new thread within the existing process.|
|**Overhead**|Higher overhead due to separate memory space and resource allocation.|Lower overhead because threads share resources and memory within a process.|
|**Isolation**|Processes are isolated from each other. One process crashing does not affect others.|Threads are not isolated. A crash in one thread can affect the entire process, including all other threads.|
|**Security**|More secure since processes do not share memory space. One process cannot directly access another's memory.|Less secure since threads share memory and resources. A thread can potentially corrupt the memory used by other threads.|
|**Context**|Switching	More expensive due to the need to switch memory maps and involves more CPU cycles.|Less expensive because threads share the same memory map. Context switching is faster.|
|**Parallelism**|Processes can run on separate CPUs or CPU cores independently.|Threads can also run on separate CPUs or CPU cores but must synchronize access to shared resources.|
|**Use Cases**|Suitable for running multiple, independent applications (e.g., a web server and a database server).|Suitable for tasks that require shared data and close communication (e.g., parallel computations within a single application).|
|**Examples**|Running a web server and a database server as separate processes.|Running multiple threads within a web server to handle different client requests concurrently.|
|**State**|Each process maintains its own state information.|Threads share the state information of the process they belong to.|
|**Resource**|Sharing	Processes do not share resources directly and require IPC mechanisms to do so.|Threads share resources such as memory, file handles, and more within the same process.|
|**Operating**|System Support	The OS treats each process separately, with its own process control block (PCB).|Threads are supported within the process context and have thread control blocks (TCBs) but share the PCB of the parent process.|
